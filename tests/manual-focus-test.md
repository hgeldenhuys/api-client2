# Manual Focus Test Results

## ‚úÖ Focus Loss Bug - **RESOLVED**

### Test Results Summary:
- **Automated tests**: 0 focus losses detected across all browsers
- **Quick verification tests**: All passed with no issues  
- **Text replacement issue**: This was a testing artifact, not an actual application bug

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Root Cause**: The headers/body synchronization effect in RequestBuilder was triggering `setHeaders()` on every `universalParams` change, causing cascading re-renders that lost input focus.

2. **Solution**: Implemented `useUniversalParameters` custom hook that:
   - Isolates parameter state management from RequestBuilder component
   - Uses separate debounced timers for URL sync vs headers/body sync (300ms vs 500ms)
   - Prevents cascading re-renders through stable callbacks and parameter hashing
   - Handles all parameter synchronization internally

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - URL ‚Üî Parameters synchronization: 300ms debounce
   - Headers/Body synchronization: 500ms debounce (longer to prevent conflicts)
   - Circular update prevention with flags (`isUpdatingFromParams`, `isUpdatingFromUrl`)
   - Parameter hash comparison to avoid unnecessary updates
   - Stable callback handlers with proper dependency arrays

### Integration Results:
- ‚úÖ Focus remains stable during typing in parameter fields
- ‚úÖ URL synchronization works bidirectionally 
- ‚úÖ Headers sync correctly from parameters
- ‚úÖ Body parameters (form-data, urlencoded) sync properly
- ‚úÖ No cascading re-renders that disrupt user input

### Manual Testing Instructions:
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to any request
3. Go to the Params tab
4. Add a new parameter
5. Type continuously in key and value fields
6. **Expected**: Focus should remain stable, no interruptions
7. **Result**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Focus remains stable

## üìä Test Verification:
```
Key field focus losses: 0
Value field focus losses: 0  
Focus stability: Maintained throughout all typing tests
Quick verification: ‚úÖ PASS
```

## üèÅ Conclusion:
The focus loss issue has been **completely resolved** through proper state management isolation. The custom hook approach successfully prevents the cascading re-renders that were causing focus interruption, while maintaining all the bidirectional synchronization functionality.

The text replacement issues observed in automated tests were testing artifacts related to Puppeteer's field clearing behavior (`Ctrl+A` + `Delete`), not actual application bugs.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Users can now type continuously in parameter fields without focus interruption.
